It performs server-side\n            rendering by default and makes our application optimized for search\n            engines. It also lets you add and make dynamic meta tags because\n            comes with a Head component that can be imported and used in other\n            pages.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Why use it</h4>\n          <p>\n            You can use it because it allows us to start very fast an\n            application. With another word when we want to create a new React\n            application, we donâ€™t need any more to set up many dependencies and\n            scripts for React to get up and running, because Next.js comes with\n            its configuration and we have only to execute simple commands like\n            npm run dev and the application will start to build. It is inspired\n            by PHP and benefits from a great system of JavaScript modules and\n            because of this, another advantage of using it is that allows you to\n            perform individual tests for each component and to download lots of\n            modules from npm.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <style jsx>{`\n          a {\n            color: grey;\n            text-decoration: none;\n          }\n        `}</style>\n      </Layout>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAdA;AAAA;AAAA;AAmCA;;;;AAtCA;AACA;AAwCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
